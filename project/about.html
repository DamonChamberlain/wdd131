            <h2>our mission: guiding your coding journey</h2>
            <p>Starting web development felt scary and confusing, so we made The Coder's Compass to be the guide we wish we had. We focus on cutting through all the confusing terms with super clear lessons on the main stuff: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We’re here to help you get the strong basics you need so you don't feel lost when you start working on your own projects.</p>

            <h2>why we focus on the core languages</h2>
            <p>There are a ton of frameworks out there, but you can't build anything stable without really knowing the basics. We focus on the core languages because they are the non-negotiable foundation for literally everything else you will build on the web. It just makes learning all the complex stuff later way easier.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**universal understanding:** these languages are the building blocks of the entire web. mastery here makes learning any framework easier.</li>
                <li>**performance:** writing efficient, clean, vanilla code often results in faster, lighter, and more accessible websites.</li>
                <li>**problem solving:** understanding how the browser actually renders and runs your code is crucial for debugging and complex problem solving.</li>
            </ul>
